        <br>

<p style="font-size:18px;">We do our best to process and ship out within 24 hours. However, in some cases when we are extremely busy (Special Drops, holidays, etc), please allow several days from when your order is placed before it is dispatched.
<br><br>
We ship out from Selangor and use the carrier J&T Express. Delivery times will vary depending on your location and the time of the year (expect slower speeds around the holidays).
<br><br>
The estimated shipping duration will be from 2-5 days. 
<br><br>
Once we drop your package off to the carrier, you will assume the risk of loss and title for the merchandise. We are not responsible for lost, misplaced, or stolen packages. Please contact your respective post office with your tracking number to remedy the situation or set up a redelivery. If items are returned to us we will contact you to set up a reshipment. Shipping charges are non-refundable. 
<br><br>
Currently, we do not ship internationally. Rest assured, we are in the midst of planning international shipping.</p>
